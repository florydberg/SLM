# SLM - Spatial Light Modulation for Optical Tweezers

## Overview
Welcome! This repository contains implementations of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm (GS) and its weighted variant (GSW) for generating phase patterns for an SLM.
Over the course of the next months we will be improving our SLM code and all updates will be here. More information on our setup and SLM devices to come. 

## Installation (this will be updated in the coming weeks)
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SLM.git
